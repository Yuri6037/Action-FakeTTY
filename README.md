# Action-FakeTTY
GitHub Action intended as a hack to fix the TTY bug of GitHub Actions by implementing a cross platform alias.
The action will be available on:
-   PowerShell for Windows runners
-   Bash for Linux runners
-   Bash for Mac OSX runners

# Why?
This Action has been developped in order to allow migrating [BlockProject 3D](https://github.com/BlockProject3D) to GitHub Actions which allows for more concurrent jobs and is slightly faster to load and build C++ projects.
